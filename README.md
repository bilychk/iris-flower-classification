# Iris Flower Classification — Deep Neural Network with Keras

This project demonstrates a clean and efficient approach to **multiclass classification** on the well-known **Iris dataset**.  
A deep neural network (DNN) was designed and trained using **TensorFlow / Keras** to accurately distinguish between the three Iris flower species — *Setosa, Versicolor,* and *Virginica*.

## Project Objectives
- Implement a modern Keras-based DNN for structured numeric data  
- Apply normalization and vectorized feature processing  
- Train and evaluate a multiclass model with high accuracy  
- Interpret model predictions and patterns between features

---

## Key Results
The trained network achieved **high classification accuracy**, correctly identifying most samples across all three species.  
Feature patterns clearly show that:
- *Petal length and width* provide the strongest separation between classes  
- Each species occupies a distinct region in the feature space
